# Telegram LLM Bot

You need to obtain 2 API tokens, for Telegram Bot and for Groq and put them in `.evn` file

### Telegram Bot API Token

1. **Open Telegram**: If you don't have Telegram installed, download it from [Telegram's website](https://telegram.org/) and create an account.

2. **Search for BotFather**: In the Telegram app, use the search function to find "BotFather". This is the official bot that helps you create and manage your Telegram bots.

3. **Start a Chat with BotFather**: Open a chat with BotFather and click on the **Start** button.

4. **Create a New Bot**:
    - Type `/newbot` and follow the instructions.
    - You will be asked to choose a name for your bot.
    - You will also need to choose a username for your bot, which must end in `bot` (e.g., `mynewbot`).

5. **Receive Your Token**: After you've successfully created your bot, BotFather will provide you with an API token. This token is a long string of letters and numbers.

### Groq API Token

Assuming "Groq" refers to a specific service that provides an API, you will need to follow the standard procedure for obtaining an API token from that service. Here's a general guide:

1. **Sign Up / Log In**: Visit the official Groq website and create an account or log in if you already have one.

2. **Navigate to API Section**:
    - Look for a section labeled "API", "Developer", "Integrations", or similar.
    - This might be found in the account settings, user profile, or a dedicated developer portal.

3. **Generate API Token**:
    - There should be an option to create or generate a new API token/key.
    - Follow the on-screen instructions to generate a new token.

4. **Save the Token**: Once generated, save the token securely. This token will be a long string of letters and numbers.

If Groq refers to a specific service not widely known, please provide more details or a link to their documentation, and I can give you more precise instructions.
